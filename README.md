The goal of this is to get a repository of audio recordings from YouTube videos. Roughly speaking, the steps are:

1. Find a video I want to listen to. For example, I'm hoping https://www.reddit.com/r/coolcstechtalks/ turns out well!
2. Send that video through `youtube-dl` and extract the audio & metadata.
3. Upload it to a place to make it easy to stream or download.

As a side goal, this is also to begin exploring TypeScript.

## Issues & Improvements

1. A queue for video uploads.
2. Web sockets for progressive updates.
3. Styling.
4. All the other bugs I'm not aware of as of yet.
